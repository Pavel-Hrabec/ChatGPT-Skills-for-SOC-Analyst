# Inspect Office macro evidence

**Skill ID:** `office-macros`

## Purpose

Static source or scanner output, auto-run entrypoints, file/network/process behavior; never execute. This skill analyzes only evidence supplied by the user or retrieved through an explicitly available, authorized, read-only connection. It does not grant access to XDR, SIEM, EDR, directory, mail, cloud, or reputation services.

## Use

Install the matching `office-macros.zip` in ChatGPT Skills. In a new chat, describe the alert or evidence and name this skill, or ask ChatGPT to apply it to the attached material. The skill analyzes evidence supplied in the chat; it does not itself connect to your SOC tools.
